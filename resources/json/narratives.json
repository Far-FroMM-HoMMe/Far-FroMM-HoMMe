        "description":"The idea of home is not as simple as it may first appear. It can be formed, threatened and taken away in a multitude of ways. To understand home is to understand yourself and your place in the world. Dive into this story to see the ways you and home exist.",
        "art":{
            "FFH-1-3":"When we think of home we often think of the physical. The house we grew up in, the park we used to play at. For Miro this was his family farm in the north of Spain. He constructs the scene of this painting with the everyday objects, animals and people that made up life on the farm. On their own these items, the tipped over bucket, or wagon outside the house, may be trivial or inconsequential but together they formed the shape of Miró’s home. Which everyday items would be essential to constructing your idea of home?",
            "FFH-1-2":"No space in the home is more personal than one’s bedroom. It is the one place for many where they can express their true nature. For Vincent, the room depicted in this painting was the first space he had to freely and fully make his own. He chose to do this by adorning the walls with his paintings. Think about your own bedroom, what things make the space quintessentially you?",
            "FFH-1-5":"Home is often more than just the physical spaces and objects we can point to and more about the people we spend our time with. For the children of this village in Boston, any space where they could get together to have fun became a homely space for them. In your own life, who are the people who carry home for you no matter the place?",
            "FFH-3-2":"Finding your sense of home in the people you are with is particularly important when maintaining a physical home is no longer possible. This was the case for many people in the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s. Many were forced out of their homes, migrating across the country in search of work. On top of finding work, this mother, as was the case for many parents, also had the responsibility of carrying some sense of home for her children. How would you construct a sense of home for others in such trying times?",
            "FFH-2-5":"Moving around and away from home is a universal fact and something which is often out of our own hands. In this portrait we see a young boy, a slave, taken from his home against his will. He waits on Mary I Stuart, an English princess who was sent away at the age of nine to marry the stadtholder of the Netherlands, William II of Orange. Both Mary and the unnamed boy find themselves far from their home countries, having had very little say in the matter. Despite their different backgrounds and paths in life, they are connected by this separation from their respective homes. In your own life, how has the idea of home connected you with those who may have very different experiences from you?",
            "FFH-2-4":"Today we often see separation from home in the form of refugees who are forced to flee from their counties due to war and strife. This was the case for Cidra who left Syria with her aunt and uncle to find refuge in Sweden. In the photo Cidra calls her mum, who remained in Syria, joy and sadness mixing with the tears in her eyes. How would you describe the shape of her home now?",
            "FFH-4-3":"Our sense of home can also be corrupted, if we are not given the space to thrive and grow. For many the online world and social media has become almost a second living space and if it were to be seen as a home then it is a home not focused on nurturing us but rather selling to us. How has our understanding of love changed in this new digital home?",
            "FFH-4-4":"In this video Luna and Roel discuss how our sense of self has changed in the digital world. Social media is about constructed appearances and digital technology aims at removing the tension and friction inherent in human interaction. How can we understand what home is if we have lost our sense of self and the ability to socialise with others?",
            "FFH-3-6":"Home is held up by the people we are with and although the physical home may be taken by factors beyond our control, it is the people who keep us afloat. In this lithograph, a family sits atop a submerged house, the women keeping the children together while the men try to find any furniture that may be floating below the water. To lose one’s home in such a way can be quite traumatic but in this scene the home remains because the people remain.",
            "FFH-3-3":"As we have seen throughout this story, home can come in any number of shapes and forms but one thing which remains is that the people transcend the physical space and when the physical home is lost it is the people who can help to reconstruct it. This was the case for the many who lost their homes in the earthquake in Fukushima, Japan in 2011. The artist constructed this lighthouse, a symbol of hope for the community, from the wood of the physical homes taken by the earthquake. When it was done, the whole community came together to hoist it up. As long as there are people, home can take shape."

        "art":{
            "FFH-1-2":"A bed to sleep in, a chair to sit on, a window to open. The bedroom, an intimate space filled with our favorite belongings, reminds us of the reassurance of having a place to rest your head.",
            "FFH-1-1":"Familiar tastes often connect us deeply to our roots. A simple meal of bread, beer, and fish, woven into our daily routines, becomes a comfort food that soothes us.",
            "FFH-3-5":"Our homes can be suddenly taken away. At times, nature’s force overwhelms us, destroying the places we call home. Still, people have recorded these moments, determined to preserve their memories.",
            "FFH-2-3":"We may suddenly become outsiders —aliens in our own land, in the place we’ve always called home. Conflicts between nations disrupt the peace and daily lives of citizens, threatening not only their safety but also their sense of identity.",
            "FFH-2-4":"When strife puts us in danger, it can tear us away from our loved ones. From Cidra's expression as she speaks to her family over the phone, we’re reminded that home is not just a place but the people we are with.",
            "FFH-4-3":"Home is not just a physical place. Social media may offer us a virtual space to belong, but endless scrolling and seeking approval — is that truly where you can feel at home? Sometimes, the place we think of as “home” can slip away from our hearts.",
            "FFH-2-2":"When separated from home, what can we hold on to? Perhaps like this soldier, thinking of and dreaming about loved ones far away may bring hope and comfort.",
            "FFH-4-2":"Some may grow tired of the digital society today and wish to go back in time. The early days of machine technology— with an old box-shaped computer? Or even the Stone Age? In which era would you find your place of belonging?",
            "FFH-3-1":"If Earth no longer offers refuge, maybe the only option left is to go to space. But can we truly build a new home there?",
            "FFH-1-3":"What does “home” mean to you? A fertile land, a safe shelter, meals shared with family. Sometimes, we rediscover belonging not by returning, but by reimagining what home can be."

        "name":"Transcience in Photography",
        "description":"Photography captures the materiality of fleeting moments, imbuing each image with inherent nostalgia. Unlike painting or sculpture, which unfold through extended creative processes, photographs freeze singular instants while simultaneously evoking what came before and after the shutter's click. Contemporary new media expand these temporal possibilities, creating dynamic parallels between past, present, and future. This narrative explores the power of the medium in the suggestion of time and transience.",
        "art":{
            "FFH-3-2":"Central to Dorothea Lange's photograph are the events preceding the shot: the economic devastation of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, which forced farmers and agricultural workers to migrate in search of work. Rather than documenting the actual events, this image of their aftermath became the defining symbol of the disaster. The photograph's power lies in its ability to make viewers connect emotionally with the human cost of these historical forces.",
            "FFH-3-4":"Michiel Anguierd's relief sketches depicting biblical flood scenes, however, do capture the moment of catastrophe itself. A striking contrast emerges between the two artists' approaches to medium and imagery. While Anguierd's sculptural medium would seem naturally suited to static representation like Lange's photograph, the artists use opposite strategies. Anguierd creates dynamic movement through diagonal bodily compositions, whereas Lange's discerning photographic eye captures the resonance of events through their quiet aftermath.",
            "FFH-2-4":"As in Lange's photograph, this image by Olivier Jobard of Syrian Refugee Cidra Fled to Sweden tells the story of a preceding flight. In the photo, a girl calls her mother who remains in Syria after the family's escape to Sweden. However, the main focus shifts toward what lies ahead in this new land of opportunity. The photograph captures both loss and the promise of a hopeful future.",
            "FFH-2-1":"Similar to the previous comparison between Lange and Anguierd, Refugees by Jan Rembowski captures the actual moment of flight. Time unfolds through horizontal linear movement from right to left across the canvas. Faces, bodies, and wagons are all directed toward whatever better fate awaits on the painting's far side, their clearly distressed expressions suggesting that anything would be preferable to what they have left behind.",
            "FFH-1-5":"In this early snapshot by Lewis Wickes Hine, he captures both the frozen moment of action and its anticipated outcome. The boy is suspended in time mid-throw, the ball destined to fly toward his teammate holding the bat, which we expect to swing through the air in response",
            "FFH-1-1":"The previous photograph exemplifies the classic snapshot—capturing a single instant in time. It contrasts completely with Pieter Claesz's still life, which through its careful attention to detail and masterful technique clearly required extensive time to create. The single light source streaming from the upper left corner suggests an attempt to capture a specific moment, perhaps representing one of the earliest artistic endeavors to achieve a 'snapshot' effect, though we know such precision could never be accomplished with photographic speed.",
            "FFH-2-3":"Rather than orchestrating the perfect composition as Claesz achieved in his still life paintings, photojournalists like Lange must seize fleeting moments as they unfold. Lange captured this image of the Wanto Company store, where owner Tatsuro Masuda had displayed an 'I AM AN AMERICAN' sign to counter rising anti-Japanese sentiment, just as Masuda was forced to close his business following the Pearl Harbor attack.",
            "FFH-4-1":"In a vintage technology store in Japan, Regina Manyara captures the experience of the past within the present time. She focuses on old video tapes, books, and CD-ROMs in the foreground while showing interested customers browsing through history in the background. She presents these objects as they are encountered in real time.",
            "FFH-4-2":"Mathilde μP's Stone Age Computer hybridizes obsolete and contemporary technologies, fusing them to create a more functional object for the future. It blends experiences of objects across temporal dimensions. Like Claesz's still life, the installation results from careful curation, yet it can also be experienced dynamically through visitor interaction.",
            "FFH-4-4":"Studio Moniker's video series animates static objects through motion graphics. The facial expressions of people in dialogue serve to embody digital emojis, a reversal of what emojis originally aimed to achieve: representing human emotion through symbols. This artwork offers a critical commentary on contemporary communication by inverting the relationship between medium and meaning."
