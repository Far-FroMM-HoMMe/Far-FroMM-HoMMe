        <label>The Stone-Age Computer is very organic, natural and in great contradiction to the conventional image of computers. The Stone-Age Computer is made like a miniature Japanese garden. The rocks, which function like a normal keyboard are imbedded in soil, moss and other living wild plants. Which shall be kept alive during the exhibition in the normal way with water, and the computer on.(Mathilde μP)</label>
