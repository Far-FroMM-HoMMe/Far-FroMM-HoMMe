        <label>This short film explores digital culture, showing how humans adapt to technology rather than vice-versa. The film highlights emojis as a safe harbor that simplify complex human emotions into binary icons. The pandemic has intensified this digital shift, with screens mediating interactions. While these interfaces offer protection, they also impact our emotional experiences, simplifying communication by reducing nuanced human expression to predefined, frictionless symbols.</label>
