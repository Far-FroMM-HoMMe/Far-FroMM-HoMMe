        <label>The painting titled ‘Refugees’ is an exceptional work in Rembowski’s oeuvre due to its large format (200 x 284 cm), use of the oil technique and subject matter. Rembowski managed to render this scene so evocatively that the lament and cries of the families, the rattle of the carts’ wheels, the hum of the river and the thunder of the approaching storm are almost audible.
