        <label>Currier &amp; Ives issued more than thirty lithographs of the great Mississippi River. As residents who lived along the Mississippi River were well aware, their fields and homes were often threatened by periodic floods when river water levels overflowed its banks. This lithograph presents Black people and white people courageously coping with such a natural disaster, while in the background, the steamboat 'Stonewall Jackson' (named for a Confederate general in the American Civil War who had died in 1863) progresses unhindered along the river.
