        <label>This painting is the second of the three distinct versions of Van Gogh's bedroom in his 'Yellow House' in Arles, France; the place where he had a home of his own for the first time. As he wrote in a letter addressed to his brother Theo, the use of bright colors was meant to express 'absolute repose', reflecting his longing for tranquility during the instability brought on by his illness.</label>
