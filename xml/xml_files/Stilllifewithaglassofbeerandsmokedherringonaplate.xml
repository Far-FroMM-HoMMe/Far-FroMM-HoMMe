        <label>This panel is a masterpiece from Pieter Claesz' monochrome period. The soft light and finely tuned colour palette in this balanced composition produces an atmosphere of calm. With its great simplicity, with only a single glass of beer, a knife, a herring, a bread and the cracked shell of a single hazelnut, this panel sings the praises of 'our daily bread'.
