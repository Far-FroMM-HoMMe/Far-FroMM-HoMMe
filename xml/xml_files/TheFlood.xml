        <label>Anguier, a French-born artist active in Rome from 1641-1651, worked with Bernini and Alessandro Algardi and was one of the latter's disciples picked to illustrate Old Testament scenes for the nave of San Giovanni in Laterano. This relief is a sketch-model for one of the series of thirteen stucco reliefs, intended as models for marbles but never subsequently executed, of Old and New Testament scenes. (The Met)</label>
