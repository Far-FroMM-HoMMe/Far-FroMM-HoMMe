        <label>A lone figure carries a net bulging with belongings – a teapot, a game, a lamp – hastily gathered. The nomadic astronaut is in search of a new home on a safe planet.With Refugee Astronaut IX (2024) Shonibare imagines a world where rising water levels have left humanity searching for new places to survive. In a world built on endless growth, we often forget that Earth’s resources are finite. But what happens when we reach the limit? (FENIX)</label>
