        <label>A project taken place in Fukushima, a region devastated by the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 2011. Wood was collected from tsunami debris to build a structured model of the Shioyazaki lighthouse, a local symbol also destroyed. The video documentary captures around 500 local participants pulling the structure upright with ropes. By recreating a lost landscape in a new form, the work expresses both the trauma of disaster and an act of renewal, reconnecting people to their home town, memory, and hope.</label>
