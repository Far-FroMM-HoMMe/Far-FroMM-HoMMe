        <label>Carmen takes its title from Bizet’s famous opera and is built around the melody of the aria Habanera. While the phrase “Love is a rebellious bird” symbolizes the free and untamed love in the original, Stromae reinterprets this “bird” as the icon of Twitter (now X), a symbol of modern social media. The animated music video offers a sharp critique of today’s social media culture, highlighting themes of addiction, consumption, the isolation and superficiality that often come with them.</label>
