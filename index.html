                        In an era of unprecedented global mobility, home seems to be closer than ever before. 
                Within hours we catch a flight or we instantly connect with our loved ones through a video call. 
                ‘Coming home’ seems to be within our control, wherever we are. But what if our homes are taken from us by external forces? 
                What ways are there of feeling at home? <br><br>
                Far From Home brings together works spanning five centuries and multiple continents, revealing how the experience of displacement 
                transcends time and geography. The exhibition traces a visual conversation across mediums. From early-modern Dutch painting to 
                Depression-era photography and contemporary digital art, each generation utilizes the medium of their age to make sense of home and its loss. 
                Pieter Claesz's meticulous still life celebrates the domestic abundance of the 17th-century Dutch Republic, while Dorothea Lange's documentary 
                lens exposes how quickly such security can vanish during crisis. Together, these works illuminate the persistent human forces (political, 
                environmental, technological) that continue to unsettle our sense of belonging. Home, that fundamental feeling of 'being at place', perhaps 
                emerges most clearly when viewed through the lens of <i>its absence.</i>
